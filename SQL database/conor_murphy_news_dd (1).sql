It comes as French President Emmanuel Macron\'s office was forced to downplay reports in the UK media that his government had offered concessions on the backstop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Mr Macron has championed the EU\'s refusal to reopen the Brexit deal but it was claimed this position was softening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">However, the Elysee Palace said last night:</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"quote\"><span class=\"quoteMarks\">\"</span> These [reports] are without any foundation...

Starting with the goalkeepers David de Gea and Alisson Becker, who are both world class, with different strengths . . . I could go on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">But there are three outstanding one-to-one battles in today\'s game and the team that comes out on top in those contests is certain to win.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"verdict\">PAUL POGBA v JORDAN HENDERSON</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"twelve\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<div class=\"five alpha\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Pogba only has eyes on the Liverpool game because he is suspended for the midweek Champions League second leg against Paris Saint-Germain while Henderson comes into this match on the back of an outstanding performance against Bayern Munich.<p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">The question is can Henderson reach those levels to get close to Pogba when he is at his best and most dangerous? The Frenchman has been excellent since the shackles of Jose Mourinho were removed and he is clearly enjoying the freedom under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"four omega\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">His burst of pace is extraordinary. It reminds me of playing against Yaya Toure. I really thought I could keep up with him but when he got into his stride, he was gone and I was thinking, \'I am going to have to rugby tackle this guy to stop him\'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">When Pogba puts his foot down and bombs into the box, there is only one winner, which was demonstrated by his goal against Chelsea in the FA Cup last week when he ghosted into the penalty area and powered his header home.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Most of the time, Henderson is a six or seven out of ten, but when he is on top of his game, playing with confidence and not carrying an injury, he is a nine, as he was against Bayern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">I reckon he is a nine or ten every day on the training ground and in the dressing room, which is why he is the Liverpool captain and Jurgen Klopp loves him so much. You need to be in the Liverpool dressing room to get his personality and see how he goes about his job and how professional he is. Klopp knows he can rely on Jordan Henderson, which is why he is in the team.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"verdict\">Verdict: Paul Pogba</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"verdict\">MO SALAH v LUKE SHAW</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">This will be a game of cat and mouse between two players who have been among the most consistent for their clubs this season and who are bound to be involved in key moments.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<div class=\"five alpha\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Salah has been among the goals again and, even though it doesn\'t feel he has been as prolific this season, he has still scored 20 goals in 35 appearances for Liverpool. And with just one goal in the last four, you get the feeling he is due one.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"four omega\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Shaw might be reluctant to go forward as much as he has under Solskjaer so far because he cannot afford to leave the gaps Salah wants to exploit. The centre-backs will have a big role to play to nullify that threat, if Shaw does manage to get forward. Victor Lindelof has been the stand-out defender in the current run but this is a big test for him.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Most of the attention surrounding Mourinho\'s exit and United\'s turnaround, has centred, inevitably, on Pogba. But Shaw turned his United career round before the Demanding One left and has continued his excellent form.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"verdict\">\r\nVerdict: Luke Shaw</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"verdict\">\r\nMARCUS RASHFORD v VIRGIL VAN DIJK</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">There is no guarantee Rashford will play through the middle for United, but I hope that is the case. It is his best position, they are much more effective when he is given the role and Romelu Lukaku is on the bench or the wings. Most importantly, it will be a fascinating tussle with Liverpool\'s best defender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Rashford is another player who has clearly benefited from Solskjaer\'s new approach and the striker is showing what he is really made of now he is concentrating solely on his football, rather than impressing the manager, and he is a menace for defenders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">He takes everything in his stride, moves with the flow and does not get too excited but he is capable of hurting you with his runs in a flash, allowing Pogba to pick up space. They are trying to stretch teams with their rotation and running power and Rashford is brilliant at creating space for others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">From the guy I saw at Walsall reserves, to one of the best defenders, Van Dijk has all the attributes to handle Rashford and Pogba as if they are Sunday League players. He is an animal and has everything, a presence and calmness and keeping things simple. He is by far closest thing we have seen to Rio Ferdinand in terms of reading the game.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"verdict\">Verdict: Virgil van Dijk</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Sunday Indo Sport</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'There are always key head-to-head battles and match-ups in big games like Manchester United versus Liverpool...', '2019-02-24', '13:00:00', 2, 2, 2),

Reagan, one of the most popular American presidents of all time, had seen his huge lead in the polls gradually whittle away to high single figures. Aged 73, his performances had seemed a little fuzzy and uncertain and the voting population needed to know whether he was still be up to the job.M</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">The moderator, Jack Truit, asked out loud what everybody had been thinking:</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"quote\"><span class=\"quoteMarks\">\"</span>Mr Reagan, you are already the oldest president in history; President Kennedy had to go for days on end with very little sleep during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Mondale cracked up and had to prevent himself from applauding his opponent\'s brilliant riposte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">The game was over, there and then. Reagan won in a landslide.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<div class=\"five alpha\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">The chances of Reagan\'s line being a moment of pure spontaneity are the same as Ireland\'s chances of losing today in Rome - but the older guy and his team knew that his age would be an issue. He remembered his lines and didn\'t fluff them in his delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">There is no substitute for experience in the sporting sphere. Every player who has played at the highest level will tell you that if you knew the stuff you knew at the end of your career when you were younger, you would be \'The Man\'. Great players are commonly seen as those who are \'wise before their years\'.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"four omega\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Italy present themselves for examination today at the Stadio Olimpico. As it has been in the Joe Schmidt era, the battle will not be with a rugged but lamentably limited blue-shirted team, but with a situation that has infected Ireland over the last four seasons. Ireland now need their experience - and experienced players - to vaccinate themselves from this type of thing happening in the big one in October.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">I am convinced that if Ireland had brought their \'A\' game to the Aviva against England and played as well as England did, they would have won. Ireland were many leagues off where they needed to be and we all put it down to being \'one of those\' and that England wanted it more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Let us remind ourselves that Ireland performed poorly three weeks ago. They did so previously in the first fixture in Paris last season, just winning 13-15. The previous season they sleepwalked to Murrayfield and got hijacked 27-22. The season before that they meandered into a 16-16 draw in the first match of the season and also suffered an off-day against the same opposition in Cardiff the season before that. Surely these unsatisfactory starts cannot have escaped their and their opponents\' notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">A Grand Slam is an incredibly difficult thing to achieve and despite our recent pre-eminence, Ireland still struggle when they have to play tournament rugby. We seem to be far better geared to winning November internationals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">I have a feeling that Ireland will win all their remaining matches, getting better and better, and saving their best performance for Wales in Cardiff which will probably garner second place for Joe Schmidt\'s team. Nobody can say that the score against Italy and the performance are not important because they are - the same goes for the French and Welsh games that are coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">The season was lost in the first game and it is important to regather and salvage something. But it all ends in the middle of March, so what relevance does it have?</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<div class=\"five alpha\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Tomorrow, an eagerly awaited Leinster Schools quarter-final will be played out between Blackrock College and St Michael\'s College. That match was delayed by an outbreak of mumps and the mid-term break. People have asked, \'What\'s the form here\', and I have answered, \'there is none.\' In the space of over three weeks a side that was on fire could have lost its spark and a side that was struggling could suddenly find it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">We expect that Ireland will recover themselves and that they will have a long nervy break to the pre-World Cup warm-up games and then on to the big show. Ireland in the interim could conceivably catch fire and go cold a couple of times before the main event.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"four omega\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Experience teaches only the teachable. We have a vintage core of experienced players - Rory Best, Johnny Sexton, Conor Murray, Peter O\'Mahony, Sean O\'Brien and Rob Kearney - the most decorated and experienced players in Irish rugby history. All these players are in or just past their prime age but carry the same age profile as the 2003 England side that won the World Cup. That win was based wholly on the experience of their leadership group who had seen it and done it all before. They were able to identify problems and iron them out before they became issues. Not even the All Blacks have the same number of caps or as experienced a spine in their team as Ireland.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">It is now incumbent upon them to finish off their Six Nations Championship with professional approach and improved performance but it is more important that they put a stop to a listless and lethargic start to the Championship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Ireland play Scotland again on Sunday, September 22 in Yokohama. It is, as we have observed, a dangerous time for Ireland. Scotland were poor in Murrayfield despite fancying themselves and Ireland pretty much had their number all game long without ever displaying any attacking verve on a concerted basis. The Scots have been spending many sleepless nights trying to come up with a plan to unseat us. Their number one trump card at this moment in time is to hope Ireland turn up in their usual pre-tournament torpor and under-perform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">There are many things that can happen between the end of the Six Nations and September. Already the astonishing number of in excess of 31 players who started in the first game of the Championship are injured prior to the commencement of the third round. Ireland will lose four or five of their starters and we hope that none of the core group - our leaders and experienced players - will be among them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">South Africa play New Zealand the day before. You can be damn sure that New Zealand will be primed to win that game and will perform to the level that is expected of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">A continued recovery of sorts starts today but from now on the focus for Ireland is to harvest their experience and not fluff their lines on the first day of the big show.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 'In one of the 1984 USA presidential election debates between the incumbent Ronald Reagan...', '2019-02-24', '14:00:00', 2, 4, 1),

It was a horrible pitch, horrible windy conditions and, to be honest, a horrible team to play against. Because they are so bad, it actually makes them more difficult to play against. If they don\'t know what to do with the ball, how are you supposed to know what they will do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">I don\'t think Ireland\'s players, their manager and his staff will have been too bothered about the performance - or the scoreline - as they headed home from Gibraltar last night.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<div class=\"five alpha\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">All that matters is that Ireland are up and running for this European qualifying campaign with a win, against a side and on a nasty surface that is going to test all the visitors to The Rock. They will be delighted with the win and even more pleased to get back on the grass in the Aviva Stadium.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"four omega\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">It is easy to sit and watch an Ireland performance like that and criticise and have a go at the team and the players. There will be plenty written and discussed about the start of Mick McCarthy\'s second reign as the manager.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">But I have played in games like that, on artificial pitches in particular, and they are absolutely awful. They are not just a leveller for teams like Gibraltar, they actually give them an advantage, especially in gale-force winds like last night. International football should not be played on plastic, it\'s as simple as that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Trying to keep control of a football on a 4G surface is like trying to control a sliotar thrown at you at full speed from 10 yards away. It took our lads a good half-hour to get used to the pace of the pitch and the conditions, and even then it is never easy because the ball pings everywhere and is virtually impossible to control. Gibraltar then played so deep that we couldn\'t run behind them and the ball didn\'t stop, or hold up as it would on grass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Of course Mick would have preferred an assured and comfortable start to the game, and maybe a goal to ease the nerves, but I suspect that once they arrived at the stadium yesterday afternoon, he knew what they were in for. A bloody hard 90 minutes, and so it proved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">The gaffer always looks more anxious than he actually is. You could hear him barking instructions and whistling throughout the game, but he will have remained calm and, at half-time, there will have been no panic or anxiety in the dressing room. The fact that the team was back out for the second half early points to that. The instructions will have remained the same - keep playing in areas where we can get runners in and we will break them down.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<div class=\"five alpha\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">For the most part, I thought Mick had a good evening on the line, with how he set his team up and his substitutions. One thing - I thought he might have been tempted to bring on James Collins and go for a target man when he withdrew Sean Maguire. Busy and always on the edge, Maguire did well and has more minutes in his legs, which is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">After four days, the winning goal had all the hallmarks of a goal from one of Mick\'s teams. After David McGoldrick\'s wide run, he managed a good pick-out to find the midfielder running into the box - Jeff Hendrick producing a nice composed finish.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"four omega\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">It is always said that goalkeepers and defenders must concentrate and stay focused for 90 minutes and we certainly saw why that is so vital when Darren Randolph made his one save just after half-time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">It was a spectacular stop. How he managed to keep out Roy Chipolina\'s firm header from a corner is beyond me because he must have been freezing and stiff as a board. I really could not see them scoring before or after that, so it was as important as Hendrick\'s winning goal.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Having been in a dressing room many times with Mick, I know he will have told the boys to put that game behind them and remind them that the job this week is only half-done. He knows it was not pretty and he will be happy to move on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">There is plenty to work on of course but, in those conditions and on that pitch, it is hard to judge the combinations put in place, like Stevens and McClean on the left or Coleman and Doherty on the right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">For the game against Georgia, on Tuesday, I think he will go 4-4-1-1 and having watched their game against Switzerland, he knows they will sit back and try catch us on the counter-attack with their two wingers and lone striker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Ireland will have to break them down, try to keep the tempo up and look for the Georgians to make mistakes. I am sure the Aviva Stadium crowd will give Mick a warm welcome back and get behind the lads, but we will all need to be patient during what could be another testing night.

It didn\'t look to me as if Ireland were trying too hard in Cardiff. The foundation stone of Joe Schmidt\'s sides has been work ethic and intelligent effort. Ireland\'s effort lacked intelligence, it was clouded by a little bit of performance anxiety and maybe they were guilty of overthinking things a bit as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Would it be fair to say that Ireland have a dose of the yips at the moment? Normally Ireland are pretty good tee to green but they really did look jumpy on the greens (inside the 22).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">How many chances did they butcher in the red zone in the 2019 Championship? Everything that is required to get over the line was missing: the ability to take contact on your own terms near the line, passing and retaining under pressure, the ability to think clearly and coolly when there is live ammunition being used and the champions\' instinct of taking your chances. Ireland did not possess all of the above when they got into try-scoring positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Where does the performance anxiety come from? We don\'t know. We wait for one of the players to break ranks and tell us all that Joe has lost the dressing room or he shouldn\'t have told us he was leaving. I don\'t think so.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<div class=\"five alpha\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Let\'s go into the realms of \'what if.\' Over the last two years I have watched our two halves play at a level that was sublime. In all the big matches Sexton and Murray played, they won them through their big-game temperament, cold-blooded precision and sheer force of personality. They had exemplar skill levels and always seemed to do the right things at the right time. There was a little bit of ying and yang too as they complemented each other\'s personalities.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"four omega\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">If our halves had played to the levels we know they are capable of, Ireland may have won another Championship. If they had executed the game-plan as efficiently as we know they can, that would have had the knock-on effect of bringing everyone else who happened to be playing badly along with them. Remember Ireland had better field position and territory in every game they played - even in the Welsh game. Ireland owned the ball for 88 per cent of the first half against France.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">It is a simple game folks - if your halves are on their game, then with field position and possession they should press home that advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Our halves though had the yips. How can you explain the breakdown in their skill levels? How does the best box-kicker in the world suddenly become distinctly average in this phase to the point that he is just kicking the ball away?</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<div class=\"five alpha\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">The fall-off in Sexton\'s skill-set was even more alarming. Think of those kick-offs. Were they aimless or just badly kicked? Some of the tactical kicking was poorly reasoned and thoughtless. How can a player of such quality kick with such diffidence when he could do it in his sleep?</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"four omega\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Place and positioning of the ball is one thing but the actual kicking style was off. The contact with the ball was far from sweet. Sexton knows where to place the ball and how to deliver it to that place but it just didn\'t happen in the Championship. How many 10-foot putts did Sexton miss?</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">If Ireland had gone 42 phases at the end of the England or Welsh games what were the odds on him getting the match-winner like he did in Paris last year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">The underperformance was compounded by Sexton\'s demeanour - maybe he did miss the angry teenager phase! You can understand why he does what he does. Quite often it is in the sinews of his will that his great performances are fashioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">We need a firewall. So the provinces need to cultivate a recovery for Sexton and Murray, let them throttle back and be themselves again. Leinster\'s style will suit Sexton as Munster\'s will suit Murray.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">The provinces will be the perfect pasture for our 9 and 10 to learn how to enjoy playing rugby again.

I think a deal was already in place and agreed before the stunning Champions League win in Paris but that incredible result will have confirmed it\'s the right decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Solskjaer deserves the job. From the day he took the role he has said and done all the right things, allowed his players to play with freedom while underlining the importance to them of playing \'the Manchester United way\'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Whatever he has brought, it has clearly worked, demonstrated by the amazing scenes in Paris on Wednesday. What a game. What a performance. What a manager. He is like a mini Alex Ferguson, saying and doing all the things like the great man.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<div class=\"five alpha\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">The biggest factor in United\'s favour on the night was the tactical bravery Solskjaer showed. Firstly, by using 4-4-2 from the start, which in the world of football these days means you are prepared to concede possession and not dominate the midfield. Solskjaer knew he could back his players in the two banks of four to be regimental and solid, while telling the front two to go out and get the goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">It will have been a case of Solskjaer saying in the dressing room before the game, \'right lads, you four and you four do the donkey work in midfield and defence and those two will win the game for us. We will wait and pounce on their mistakes because PSG will make mistakes and give you chances.\'</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"four omega\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">Then, to go 5-4-1 after the second goal, and for the team to buy into it and sit back until the last 10 minutes to then go out and win the game was another brave move. I am sure there were coaches throughout the world watching the game full of admiration for his approach and the changes he dared to make throughout. Many of them will have been thinking: \'I can see what you\'re trying to do there, and I like it, but there is no way I\'d be prepared to risk it.\' Fortunately for Manchester United, Solskjaer was prepared to gamble, and it certainly paid off.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">The transformation in certain United players under Solskjaer is incredible, but in the case of Romelu Lukaku, it has taken time. The Belgian striker dropped it into his post-match interviews that, when he took over, Solskjaer came up with a plan to get the best out of him. It needed something. After the World Cup, I said that I didn\'t think Lukaku was sharp enough and quick enough compared to the player who was burning down the wings in Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">He turned back into that beast in the French capital on Wednesday night. Lukaku is all about pace, power and physicality, but Jose Mourinho wanted to turn him into Didier Drogba. That was never going to come off because Lukaku will never have the same attributes and strengths as the former Chelsea striker. His biggest asset is his pace, which is why the majority of his goals at Everton came from simply running through on goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">After the game, Lukaku admitted it had taken three or four weeks of work on his finishing and movement to get back to the levels he had reached in the summer, but he had stuck to and understood Solskjaer\'s plan.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<div class=\"five alpha\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">I don\'t think Mourinho was fully focused on the job and on the football when he went to Manchester United. There were too many distractions and bits and pieces off the pitch which he became embroiled in and I think he struggled to move north from London.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"four omega\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">The positive impact Solskjaer has had is in marked contrast to Unai Emery\'s first season at Arsenal. Have Arsenal improved since they delivered most fans\' wishes and got rid of Arsene Wenger? No, I don\'t think so.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"twelve alpha omega\">\r\n<div class=\"nine alpha omega marginBottom\">\r\n<p class=\"story\">They are still in the Europa League (just), still challenging for the top four, but they would have expected that at least under Wenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">Emery has still not found the right formula and bringing back Mesut Ozil says it all. He is searching for his best team, and I suspect his best team would include Aaron Ramsey, but he has been allowed to leave on a free transfer this summer. That is a really sad situation for Arsenal, and it must be especially galling to the club and the supporters to lose a player like Ramsey to a club like Juventus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">The good news for the Premier League is that all the top six are still in Europe, ahead of Liverpool and Manchester City playing their Champions League second-leg ties this week. It is going to be a tough one for Jurgen Klopp going to Bayern Munich after the goalless draw at Anfield, but it would be great to see them survive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"story\">You could see any one of the four English clubs winning the Champions League, and Chelsea and Arsenal challenging all the way for the Europa League.
